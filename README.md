# My Employee Tracker

## Description

This project challenged me to use a server to deplay an app..

During this project I learned how to:

- setup a server with express.js.
- create a datbase with a json file.
- read and write to a json file.
- setup routes for a server.
- use input fields to get data from a user.
- hide and show html elements with eventlisteners.
- using fetch to get data.
- using the post request to send data.
